# Ciarans-Unity-Library
A library of functions for the Unity Engine. Its essentially designed to be dropped into your project and then used just like MathF or Physics. 
A lot of it is probably needless, but a lot of it is stuff I genuinely find myself using all the time. I primarily keep this for my own use, but its freely avalable for whoever.
